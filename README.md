## Goal:
The goal of my Power BI logistics dashboard is to provide a comprehensive, interactive view of key logistics and sales metrics to drive operational efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and improved team performance. It tracks essential logistics indicators such as **Revenue**, **Total Shipments**, **Active Shipments**, **Returned Shipments**, **Completed Shipments**, and **Average Delivery Time**, offering insights into the performance of shipments and delivery operations. 

The dashboard also includes analysis of **Product Categories**, **Country Names**, and **Average Time by Geography**, helping to pinpoint regional and product-specific inefficiencies. Additionally, it tracks **Salesperson Individual Performance**, enabling management to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of each team member. 

The dashboard also visualizes trends such as **Revenue by Month**, **Shipments by Month**, and **Yearly Performance**, allowing for better forecasting, capacity planning, and resource allocation. Overall, this tool empowers stakeholders to identify bottlenecks, optimize resources, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall logistics and sales performance.


## Dataset: 
The goal of my Power BI logistics dashboard is to integrate and visualize data from four key datasets to improve logistics and sales performance. These datasets are:

Country Dataset: Includes information on Geography and Region, helping to analyze shipments across different regions and geographies.

Products Dataset: Contains Product, Category, and Cost per Box, enabling analysis of product performance, categories, and cost efficiency.

Salesperson Dataset: Tracks Salesperson, Team, and Picture, allowing evaluation of individual salesperson performance and team dynamics.

Shipments Dataset: Provides shipment-specific details like Shipment ID, Salesperson, Geography, Product, Date, Sales, Status, and Delivered On, offering insights into shipment performance, delivery timelines, and sales tracking.

By combining these datasets, the dashboard provides actionable insights on sales performance, regional trends, product efficiency, and shipment status. It enables data-driven decisions for optimizing logistics, sales efforts, and overall operational performance.
